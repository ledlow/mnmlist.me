The site that I've created wouldn't be possible without the wonderful inspiration that Leo Babauta shares on his [site](http://mnmlist.com) of similar URL naming.

I sincerely hope if he ever becomes aware of my site, he'll consider it the homage that it is towards his words and sharing of experiences.
