I have had this since the third grade. A boy from Japan named Hiroki gave it to me. It is designed to sit on the top of your pencil, but I have always just had it stand like an action figure. 

I came across this in my garage today and remembered Hiroki. Wherever he is, I hope he hung on to some of these as well.
