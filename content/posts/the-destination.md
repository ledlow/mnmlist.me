<p>You&rsquo;ll know it when you get there. Not right away. You&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;re still on the journey. Sometimes a person's destination is happiness or even just calm. No matter what your destination is, I believe you don&rsquo;t know when you immediately arrive, but rather once you&rsquo;ve been there awhile.</p>
