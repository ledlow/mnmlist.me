<p>Today I decluttered something in my life that takes up no physical space at all.  I made the decision to *unsubscribe* from RSS feeds as a means of consuming content.  I removed the apps from my devices and turned my Feed Wrangler account off auto-renew.</p>

<p>I decided that there were just too many &ldquo;inboxes&rdquo; in my life.  Too many badges with an unread count that made me feel guilty for my lack of attention.  Too many times where I am standing in line and have the instant instinct to pull out my phone and catch up on the very very important tech news of the day.</p>

<p>This is ridiculous.  The stress that those unread counts generate is not nearly offset by the value RSS brings me.  I have created a folder of Bookmarks to the sites that I still wish to follow.  I know that there will be times that I miss a great article that I wouldn&rsquo;t have passed over when using RSS, but I think I&rsquo;m safe from harm.  It is likely that if the article is **that** good, I&rsquo;ll hear about it on a social service like ADN or Twitter.</p>

<p>I feel lighter.  I feel free from the distractions of an unread count.  I feel like content can no longer consume me versus the opposite and intended hierarchy of life.  Kickass.</p>
