For some time now I've debated on whether or not to keep this site active.  I hadn't written here for many months and the domain name renewal came due.  I've started and abandoned websites before, but this one felt like one that shouldn't meet the same fate.

Maybe I should stop treating NOT writing as a form of minimalism.
