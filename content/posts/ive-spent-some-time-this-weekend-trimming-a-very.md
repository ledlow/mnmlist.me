<p>I spent some time this weekend trimming a very large oak tree in my back yard.  It canopies my home and I prune it by standing on my roof with a long pole saw.  As the unnecessary branches that are being cut fall away, the tree looks renewed.  The oak is losing pieces of itself, but it is better for it.</p>

<p>My work on the oak this weekend shall serve as a metaphor.</p>
