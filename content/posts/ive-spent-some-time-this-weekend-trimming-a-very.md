I&rsquo;ve spent some time this weekend trimming a very large oak tree in my back yard.  It canopies my home and I prune it by standing on my roof with a long pole saw.  As the unnecessary branches that are being cut fall away, the tree looks renewed.  The oak is losing pieces of itself, but it is better for it.

My work on the oak this weekend shall serve as a metaphor.
