We’re approaching a time when a more geek form of minimalist opportunity presents itself. In the not too distant future, Apple will release the new version of Mac OS X. With Mavericks I will take the opportunity to do a “clean” install. I won’t upgrade my existing Mountain Lion to Mavericks and transfer all the apps and settings that I no longer use to the new version. Starting fresh without anything but the bare minimum feels so good. Finding those apps that are no longer necessary due to system enhancements is like getting rid of old clothes that don’t fit anymore.

I’m really looking forward to it.
