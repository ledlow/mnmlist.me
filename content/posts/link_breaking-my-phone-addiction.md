Matt Galligan, writing one his [blog](https://mattgalligan.com/one-sec-review/):

> Let's be honest here…I'd suspect that very few of us wake up excited to know that we're likely going to spend hours on end staring at our pocket computers. To make matters worse, we've seen by way of things such as Netflix's The Social Dilemma that many of the apps have weapons-grade attention-grabbing, addictive tactics employed everywhere.

This is a great walk-through of using the combo of iOS Shortcuts Automations and an app called [one sec](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/one-sec-take-a-deep-breath/id1532875441) to curb absent-minded app “grazing”. 

My approach has been to remove the apps stealing my attention from my phone all together, but that’s not always the best option for all based on individual circumstances.
