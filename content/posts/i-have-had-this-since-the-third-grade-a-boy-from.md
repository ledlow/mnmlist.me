I have had this since the third grade. A boy from Japan named Hiroki gave it to me. It is designed to sit on the top of your pencil, but I have always just had it stand like an action figure. 

I came across this in my garage today and remembered Hiroki. Wherever he is, I hope he hung on to some of these as well. <img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/9a72595476f5e1aab33783746298c387/tumblr_nqn1mdaGmh1sb53a4o1_1280.jpg">
