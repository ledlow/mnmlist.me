In my bedroom I have opted for the choice of simplicity.  I have a very minimal platform bed.  It is a simple frame that hovers a few inches off the ground.  It has no drawers.  It has no headboard or footboard.  The mattress is an 8-inch thick model that is comfortable and supportive, but not overly padded.  It requires no box spring.   I have a writing desk with a single small drawer in the front.  I have a knockoff Eames chair in white.  I have a set of 3 nesting tables.  I have them spread out in the room and each one has a purpose.  All of the furniture is made from real wood.  I did not make this a requirement, however, I found the items and it was a selling point for me.  I have one picture hung on the wall that inspires me.

These are the only furnishings in my bedroom.  There is no television.  There is no computer.  If I want to watch something, I stream it on my iPad.  If I want to do something online, I use my phone or iPad.  The only thing I plan to add is a simple bedside lamp.  The one I want is a simple ceramic design from Target that I will purchase soon.

The choice of simplicity can be so rewarding.
