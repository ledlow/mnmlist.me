<p><p>Several months ago, I found this sketch on a small piece of paper tucked behind the lattice wood wall next to my table in Cracker Barrel (a restaurant). </p>

<p>Someone sitting at the table before me had decided to use the rectangular piece of paper that binds the napkin holding the silverware for something wonderful. That person then decided to leave it tucked away for someone to find. </p>

<p>I was so happy to be that person. </p>

<p>I kept it. I wanted to write about it. Then I spilled coffee on it. At first, I was upset that I&rsquo;d tarnished such a simple joy. Then I realized that the stain only adds more to the item.</p>

<p>Someday I will sketch something on the other side and leave it at a Cracker Barrel for someone else to discover and hopefully enjoy as much as I have.</p>
