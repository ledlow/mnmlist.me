Hi, I'm [Steve](https://steveledlow.com).  Testing CI process part 7.

mnmlist.me runs on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).  The theme is a fork of [Sam](https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-theme-sam).  Sam is built and maintained by [Victoria Drake](https://victoria.dev).  Here's her [GitHub](https://github.com/victoriadrake).

Thanks for stopping by.
